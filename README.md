 Motivation Sometime we saw a trailer of a movie or series and made a mental note  to watch it only to remember after it finishes its theatrical run or TV air. Again, we lose track of which episode we are currently bingeing on or  which series is coming out each season. There are many who watch too much TV. From drama series, Anime,  movies to reality TV shows, there is always something one need to catch  up on when finally one gets home from work. As for movies, series, and  other shows, many personally prefer having a catalogue of all the things they have ever watched in their life. It can also help to keep every book  one has read. That, and the option of keeping an personal watch list for  future reference to share with friends.
