Motivation Sometimes we see a trailer for a movie or series and make a mental note to watch it, only to remember after it finishes its theatrical run or TV airing. Again, we lose track of which episode we are currently bingeing on or which series is coming out each season. There are many who watch too much TV. From drama series, anime, movies, movies to reality TV shows, there is always something to catch up on when one finally gets home from work. As for movies, series, and other shows, many personally prefer having a catalog of all the things they have ever watched in their lives. It can also help to keep every book one has read. That, and the option of keeping a personal watch list for future reference to share with friends Prospective clients for software Our prospective clients are all the people who want to keep track of everything they have watched or read and want to be up to date with everything that is coming every season.
